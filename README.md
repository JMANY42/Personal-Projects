# Personal-Projects
This is a repository of all the projects I have undertaken so far in my computer science career.

Includes Card Sharks clone, my Chess AI, my snake AI, my Minesweeper AI, and my Conway's game of life simulation, my four player chess timer, a version of tic tac toe with different size pieces.

All of these projects are written in pure Java.

Please take a look at everything you see here.

Thank you so much!
