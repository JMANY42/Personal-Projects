This was a little side project I made quickly so me and my friends could play four player chess and actually finish in one class. It is crude and unpolished but it got the job done.
Run FourPlayerChessTimer.java to run the timer

What I learned: I got more familiar with keyboard inputs by making this.

Problems: The window does not scale at all, it doesn't check how long a name is, and it is overall kinda ugly
