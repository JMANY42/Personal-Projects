I don't remember when I made this or why I made this, but going through my old code I found this and it is honestly kinda cool. It's just like normal tic tac toe but you have different sizes of pieces and bigger pieces can be played on top of smaller pieces. I really like this.

I probably made this sometime in the fall of my junior year before I really expiremented with java graphics.
