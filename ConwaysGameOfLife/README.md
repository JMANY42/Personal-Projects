This is both versions of my Conway's game of life simulator. I made this after learning about Conway's game of life and being fascinated by it. I made this around Easter in my junior year. 
Run InitLife.java or InitLife2.java to run each version of the simulator.


Actually making the simulator wasn't hard. The hard part was integrating it with Java Graphics.
v1 uses a static frame with boundaries which I didn't like, so I made v2

v2 uses a dynamic board with an infinite grid as well as an iterate forever option.

v2 can be zoomed in and out using the up and down arrow keys and moved around with WASD

What I learned:
This was the first time I had experiemented with multi threading in order to make the simulation constanltly run and so you can move around and zoom in and out. 

Problems: You can't zoom out past a certain resolution. This is my only complaint with this project. I am very pleased with it.
